# Spacey Group Project

A group project from my time at Enspiral Dev Academy

The goal of the project was to make a web app that utilized spaced interval learning. The process whereby retention of information is increased by reviewing facts and information over progressively spaced interals. 

In order to run the project, clone and then npm i.
